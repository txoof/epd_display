    "When PaperPi starts, all plugins that are configured and active are added as `self.update_function` to a generic `Plugin` class. This happens automatically and is managed for you. The `Plugin` class offers several built-in functions and properties that plugins can take advantage of. See the \"BUILTIN FUNCTIONS\" section below.\n",

    "**Plugin Class Methods and Properties**\n",
